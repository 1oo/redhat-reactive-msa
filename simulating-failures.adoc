## Simulating a failure

To simulate a failure, take one of the greeting service and reduce the number of pods to 0. Thus, the addresses the service handled on the event bus won't be listened / managed anymore.

In the _browser as client_, failures are managed by the browser.
In the _api gateway_, the failures are managed by the server using a reply timeout.
In the _service chaining_, the failures are managed using a vert.x circuit breaker. You can check the state of the circuit breakers in the _circuit breaker_ view.

For example, if you shutdown _namaste_, you are going to see:

* `Error getting value from service namaste-service` in the _browser as client_
* `D'oh! can't invoke namaste` in the _api gateway_
* `namaste : failed!` in the _service chaining_

Then, you can restore one pod of the service to go back to the "normal" state. Be aware that restoring the "normal" state may take a couple of seconds until it finishes to start, joins the cluster and becomes discoverable by the other services.

On the service chaining, the failure may be handled earlier, as the circuit breaker protected the call to the next service may reach a timeout because the invocation are slowdown by the missing service. Check the circuit breaker view to see the circuit breaker state.
