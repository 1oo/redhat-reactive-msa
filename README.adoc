# Redhat Reactive Microservice demo

This demo explains how you can build reactive microservices with Vert.x and Node.JS. The demo runs on Openshift v3.

The microservices interacts using the vert.x event bus. A frontend service offers a UI to runs the different scenarii:

* the browser calls all the services
* the browser calls a first service, calling a secnd one, callign a third one...
* the browser calls a REST endpoint provided by an API gateway aggregating the response of the different services

The different microservices are:

* Frontend - host the main UI
* Hello - developed in Java
* Ola - developed in Groovy
* Hola - developed in JavaScript
* Namaste - developed in Ruby
* Bonjour - developed in JavaScript, and running on Node.JS
