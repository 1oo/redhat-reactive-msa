## Deploy Zookeeper

Zookeeper is used to maintain the Vert.x cluster. To deploy it just run the following commands:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-reactive-msa/zookeeper
cd zookeeper/
oc new-build --binary --name=zookeeper -l app=zookeeper
oc start-build zookeeper --from-dir=. --follow
oc new-app zookeeper -l app=zookeeper
oc expose service zookeeper
----

Then, if you launch `oc get pods`, you should see a `zookeeper` pod running.
